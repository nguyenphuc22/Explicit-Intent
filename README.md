# Explicit-Intent

Android Explicit intent specifies the component to be invoked from activity. In other words, we can call another activity in android by explicit intent.

Example : We have activity A and B so You want to move from Activity A to B. You used intent.

When intent from A to B, You want to move the data at the same time. We have two ways to do it.
